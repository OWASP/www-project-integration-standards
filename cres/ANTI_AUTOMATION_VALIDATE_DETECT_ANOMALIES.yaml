description: Verify that anti-automation controls are effective at mitigating breached
  credential testing, brute force, and account lockout attacks. Such controls include
  blocking the most common breached passwords, soft lockouts, rate limiting, CAPTCHA,
  ever increasing delays between attempts, IP address restrictions, or risk-based
  restrictions such as location, first login on a device, recent attempts to unlock
  the account, or similar. Verify that no more than 100 failed attempts per hour is
  possible on a single account.
