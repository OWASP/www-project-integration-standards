    description: Verify that the application has protection from sub-domain takeovers
      if the application relies upon DNS entries or DNS sub-domains, such as expired
      domain names, out of date DNS pointers or CNAMEs, expired projects at public
      source code repos, or transient cloud APIs, serverless functions, or storage
      buckets (autogen-bucket-id.cloud.example.com) or similar. Protections can include
      ensuring that DNS names used by applications are regularly checked for expiry
      or change.
