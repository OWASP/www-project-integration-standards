description: Verify that the application has protection from sub-domain takeovers
  if the application relies upon DNS entries or DNS sub-domains, such as expired domain
  names, out of date DNS pointers or CNAMEs, expired projects at public source code
  repos, or transient cloud APIs, serverless functions, or storage buckets (autogen-bucket-id.cloud.example.com)
  or similar. Protections can include ensuring that DNS names used by applications
  are regularly checked for expiry or change.
