pitch: Standards of integration between different OWASP projects to properly handle data from and to other tools and documents incorporated in the SDLC

## Motivation

The needs and desires of application security engineers are blooming day by day. In response to their needs, plenty of projects are surfacing. Each of these projects fulfill a given need in the SDLC flow (_e.g._ threat modeling, security tests, etc.).

These projects have no standards to handle data from and to other projects, thus, leaving them as a project that fulfills a single functionality in the SDLC, and doesn't provide any way to link it to other parts of the lifecycle.

This project's vision is to set in place a way for integration to occur between OWASP projects and other projects in the SDLC.

## Project roadmap

The below is a rough estimation as it is dependent on other projects' time and availability.

- End of Q4 2019: Design Phase deliverables for OWASP projects integration.
- Start of Q1 2020: documents detailing how mature projects should start working to allow proper integration with other tools.
- Start of Q2 2020: Review and have a retrospective session with the project leaders to identify how well the integration planning took into consideration their needs.
- End of Q2 2020: Launch a new cycle for the project in order to tackle identified issues and to identify standards that could fit the projects on a wider scope, and not only for mature projects.

The roadmap will be adjusted as the project moves forward.

The end goal would be to create a set of rules for any project under a category of the SSDLC (_e.g._ Release, Build, etc.) to be able to communicate with other projects from other categories, no matter the company nor the product.
