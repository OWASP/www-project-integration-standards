pitch: Standards of integration between different OWASP projects to properly handle data from and to other tools and documents incorporated in the SDLC

---

The Integration Standards project has a goal of creating a repository that sets up a unified ID that is built on top of requirements, which makes it very descriptive for developers and application security experts to implement in their work. It will contain mappings between requirements, testing measures, how they can be done, and other frameworks (such as ENISA, CWE, CAPEC, etc.).

## Motivation

The needs and desires of application security engineers are blooming day by day. In response to their needs, plenty of projects are surfacing. Each of these projects fulfill a given need in the SDLC flow (_e.g._ threat modeling, security tests, etc.).

These projects have no standards to handle data from and to other projects, thus, leaving them as a project that fulfills a single functionality in the SDLC, and doesn't provide any way to link it to other parts of the lifecycle.

This project's vision is to set in place a way for integration to occur between OWASP projects and other projects in the SDLC.

## Project roadmap

The below is a rough estimation as it is dependent on other projects' time and availability.

- End of Q1 2020: Design phase; the project has a clear vision on its deliverables, with proper feedback on its way forward.
- Start of Q2 2020: Plan the setup of the project and start tackling it, by first identifying the feeding projects and the links to be done between frameworks.
- End of Q3 2020: MVP release where a proper requirements set has been established and released for testing to be conducted on the standard being proposed.

The roadmap will be adjusted as the project moves forward.

The end goal would be to create a set of rules for any project under a category of the SSDLC (_e.g._ Release, Build, etc.) to be able to communicate with other projects from other categories, no matter the company nor the product.
